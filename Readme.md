## So you have a cool game idea... üí°

But when it comes time to make your idea, you run into all sorts of roadblocks:

1. **Scope**. You're unsure how to scope your idea down into something manageable.
2. **Work breakdown**. You're unsure how to break your idea into bite-sized development tasks.
3. **Progress**. Your codebase becomes tangled as you add features, so you struggle to make progress.

The result? You fail to ship your game project ‚Äì one that you're actually proud to show to your friends.

## A game developer can dream... üí≠

But what if you knew exactly how to scope your idea down, while keeping the spirit of your original idea?

What if you knew exactly how to break your idea into bite-sized tasks that you can start tackling today?

And what if adding features to your game was a joy, not a chore?

You'd be eager to work on your game every day.

You‚Äôd ship your game with confidence and momentum, and you‚Äôd be proud to show your finished game to your friends.

But... how?

## Learn how to make games by example, with a Game Codebase Tour ü¶Æ

You need an example. A role model.

An actual, finished game project whose codebase (and process) you can study and reference.

A Game Codebase Tour is exactly that. It's a guided codebase that:

1. implements a game genre (match-3, roguelike, deckbuilder, etc.), and
2. walks you through the game's codebase with highly-polished, professional-quality pull requests.

## The Tour: Factory Builders üè≠

This particular Game Codebase Tour walks you through how to create a factory builder game like Factorio:
