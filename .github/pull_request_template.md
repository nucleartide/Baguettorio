## Development checklist

> Review `Files changed` and check off the following:

* [ ] General review to clean up your changes. Then,
* [ ] **Modular**: Are you touching the scene file? If so, can you limit your changes to prefab files instead?
* [ ] **Editable**: Has any configuration been moved into ScriptableObjects, so that modified values persist even after exiting Play mode?
* [ ] **Debuggable**: Do you have debug views for the prefabs/systems that you are creating?
* [ ] Update readme with new pull request.
* [ ] **Playtesting**: If you have a design hypothesis that you'd like to test, try playtesting with friends, family, Twitter, or folks on Discord.
* [ ] **Onboarding**: Consider how the player will learn what you implement in this pull request. What are the affordances and signifiers? What is the overall experience?
* [ ] **quality assurance and screen recording** once everything is wrapped up, to lead off the pull request
