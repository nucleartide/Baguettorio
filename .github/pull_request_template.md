## Development checklist

> Consider Ryan Hipple's 3 engineering values:
> 
> * Modular
>     * Systems not dependent on each other
>     * Scenes are clean slates
>     * Prefabs work on their own
>     * Components (in Unity)
> * Editable
>     * Focus on data
>     * Change the game without code
>     * Emergent design
>     * Change at runtime
> * Debuggable
>     * Test in isolation (modularity)
>     * Debug views and features
>     * Never fix a bug you do not understand
> 
> In what ways do I need to modify this pull request to align with Ryan's 3 values?
