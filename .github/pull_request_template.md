### Development Checklist

> Run through the following steps to complete your work.

* [ ] **First draft**. Implement a working first pass at the problem. Try to think modularly, and think of which prefab piece you will modify versus the entire scene.
* [ ] **Final draft**. Once done, perform a general review of `Files changed` and revise anything that needs to be cleaned up.

### Quality Assurance Checklist

> Ensure that your work adheres to the following principles.

* [ ] **Modular**. Are you touching the scene file? If so, can you limit your changes to prefab files instead?
* [ ] **Editable**. Has any configuration been moved into ScriptableObjects, so that modified values persist even after exiting Play mode?
* [ ] **Debuggable**. Do you have debug views for the prefabs/systems that you are creating?
* [ ] **Learnable**. Consider how the player will learn what you implement in this pull request. Are the affordances appropriately communicated with signifiers?
