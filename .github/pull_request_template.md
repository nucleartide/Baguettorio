## Development Checklist

> Run through the following steps to complete your work.

* [ ] Implement a rough first draft.

> Ensure that your work adheres to the following principles.

* [ ] **Debuggable**. Do you have debug views for the prefabs/systems that you are creating?
* [ ] **Learnable**. Consider how the player will learn what you implement in this pull request. Are the affordances appropriately communicated with signifiers?
