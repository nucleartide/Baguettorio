## Motivation

So you want to break into the game industry.

And your goal is to work as a game programmer at a game studio.

But all these jobs ask for shipped games, and you don't have that.

You might have 1 or 2 game jam projects lying around, but nothing substantial enough to showcase your game programming skills.

The result? You find it hard to land game programming jobs. You might send out application after application, but to no avail.

That's expected; breaking into games is supposed to be hard.

But is there a better way?

---

In an ideal world, finding work would be easy.

You'd have a portfolio of shipped games that **demonstrate** and **speak to** your game programming skills.

Game studios would respond to your job applications immediately, because it's very clear that you have what it takes.

You'd be making games, and *getting paid for it*.

But... how?

Yes, yes, "just make games" is good advice. But you want something more specific than vague platitudes.
