# ðŸ¥– Breadforge

An open source factory builder game about building a bread factory. Made in Unity 2021.

Simultaneously, the project demonstrates all the skills needed to ship a game from idea to Steam launch.

## Motivation

So you want to break into the game industry.

And your goal is to work as a game programmer at a game studio.

But all these jobs ask for shipped games, and you don't have that.

You might have 1 or 2 game jam projects lying around, but nothing substantial enough to showcase your game programming skills.

The result? You find it hard to land game programming jobs. You might send out application after application, but to no avail.

That's expected; breaking into games is supposed to be hard.

But is there a better way?

## In an ideal world

In an ideal world, finding work would be easy.

You'd have a portfolio of shipped games that **demonstrate** and **speak to** your game programming skills.

Game studios would respond to your job applications immediately, because it's very clear that you have what it takes.

You'd be making games, and *getting paid for it*.

But... how?

Yes, yes, "just make games" is good advice. But you want something more specific than vague platitudes.

## You need an example

You need an example.

A role model of how to build a game from idea to Steam launch.

And not only an example of how to code the game, but also all the *professional* skills around it, such as code quality, production pipelines, and scope management.

- [ ]  you need more polish. more professionalism and excellence at certain skills.

That's what this game project (Breadforge) addresses.

Breadforge is a factory builder game, but this project documents my journey from senior full-stack engineer to professional Unity gameplay programmer.

How specifically do I demonstrate the ability of a professional game programmer? Read on to learn more ðŸ‘‡

## The Playful Production Process: a personal narrative

In the book *Playful Production Process* by Richard Lemarchand, Lemarchand breaks the process of game development into ideation, pre-production, production, post-production.

A full production pipeline for producing any kind of game. And the "narrative frame" for showing you (by way of polished, professional-quality pull requests) how a game is made from idea to launch.
