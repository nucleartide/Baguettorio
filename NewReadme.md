# ðŸ¥– Breadforge

> *(trailer / GIF goes here soon...)*

A factory builder game about building a bread factory. Made in Unity 2021.

Simultaneously, this open source project demonstrates the complete skillset needed to ship a game: from idea to Steam launch. ðŸš€

<br />

## Motivation

Making games is hard.

Because when it comes time to make your idea come to life, you run into all sorts of roadblocks:

1. **Scope**. You're unsure how to scope your idea down into something manageable.
2. **Work breakdown**. You're unsure how to break your idea down into bite-sized development tasks.
3. **Progress**. Your codebase becomes tangled as you add features, so you struggle to make progress.

The result? You never ship your game, and all that time you spent was for naught.

But what if you knewÂ exactlyÂ how to scope your idea down, while keeping the spirit of your original inspiration?

What if you knewÂ exactlyÂ how to break your idea down into bite-sized tasks, so that you can start tackling them today?

And what if adding features to your game was aÂ **joy**, not a chore?

You'd be eager to work on your game every day. And youâ€™d ship your game with confidence and momentum.

But... how?

---

You need a role model.

A codebase that **demonstrates** and **speaks to** every skill of a professional game programmer â€” skills such as code quality, playtesting, production pipelines, and scope management.

And in doing so, the codebase would showcase every aspect of the game production process, so that you can apply its learnings to your own work.

That's what this project Breadforge provides.

## Playful Production Process: a story told through pull requests

In the book *A Playful Production Process*, the author Richard Lemarchand breaks the process of game development into four stages: ideation, pre-production, production, and post-production.

Much like the chapters of a novel, I tell the story of Breadforge's development through its cumulative pull requests. Occasionally, I also narrate batches of pull requests in the form of a "painlog".

Devlogs are about *me*; painlogs are about *you*. Instead of describing what I've done, a painlog describes the general *pain point* behind a batch of pull requests, and what you can take away from my struggles.

You can view those chapters below:

## I. Pre-production

*Note that an ideation section is skipped to focus on the latter 3 stages of development.*

### Chapter 1. The 3 Cs Toolkit in Unity (2023)

> Make your character come to life with Mecanim, Cinemachine, and Input System.

The 3 Cs are the basic building blocks of any game with a 3D character avatar.

In March 2023, I gave a presentation at the [Unity NYC meetup](https://www.meetup.com/unity3d/events/291639476/) about how to implement the 3 Cs in Unity.

You can read the blog post behind the presentation here: [jasont.co/character-creation-toolkit](https://jasont.co/character-creation-toolkit/)

## Follow along

something for everyone

- hiring managers
- peers â†’ learn how to, but less so than newbies
- newbies â†’ learn how to
- customers â†’ the game

The best way to follow along progress is to watch and star this project, and learn as the project progresses toward completion.
every saturday: add a presentation to your painlog
